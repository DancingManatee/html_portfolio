<h3>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</h3>
<p>
    I still remember watching this movie with my brothers in the living room of one of our old houses. I can recite more lines from this movie than any other. Like many other movies it inspired us to fight with eachother. KOWABUNGA!!! 
</p>

<h3>Bloodsport</h3>
<p>
    Another movie that inspired us to fight. So much ass kicking in this one. The scene where Chun-li pops a mans shin bone out of his leg still gives me the willies. "Now I break you, like I break your friend!"
</p>

<h3>Home Alone</h3>
<p>This one is a change of pace from the others. We loved watching this movie as kids and imagined all kinds of booby traps, should we need to defend our home from burglers. I am fortunate that I get to continue watching this movie with my family ever Christmas. </p>
